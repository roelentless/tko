# tko

**An experiment in token-optimizing outputs for agents.**

`tko` intercepts CLI commands via a Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook and rewrites their output into a more compact form before the agent sees it.

```
git status  →  471 tokens     tko -- git status  →  201 tokens   (-58%)
```

Each handler targets a specific command and argument pattern. No LLM calls, no heuristics — deterministic output you can read and predict.

If a command can't be compressed losslessly, it is passed through unchanged.

---

**Scope.** Handlers are added for commands that produce repetitive, structural output: `git status`, `git log`, `ls`. Commands where the output is the point — `git diff path/to/file`, `grep`, `rg`, `jq` — are left alone.

---

## How it works

A Claude Code `PreToolUse` hook intercepts every shell command. If `tko` has a handler for it, the command is silently rewritten: `git status` → `tko -- git status`. The agent sees compressed output with identical semantics.

No prompt changes. No agent awareness. Just fewer tokens.

---

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roelentless/tko/main/install.sh | sh
```

Installs to `~/.local/bin/tko`, adds it to your PATH, and registers the Claude Code hook. Restart Claude Code. Done.

**Build from source** (requires Go 1.22+):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/roelentless/tko
cd tko
make install          # builds + copies to ~/.local/bin/tko
tko hook install      # patches ~/.claude/settings.json
```

## What gets compressed

All handlers are lossless. Commands that can't be compressed losslessly are passed through raw.

| Command | What's stripped | Always lossless |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `git status` | Instructional text; files brace-grouped by dir/extension | yes |
| `git log --oneline` | Trailing whitespace only | yes |
| `git log -n N` (N ≤ 20) | Author/date boilerplate; shows hash + date + subject | yes |
| `git show` | Commit header boilerplate; diff headers stripped | yes (falls back to raw if diff is large) |
| `ls` / `ls -la` | Collapses to single-line count; strips permission/owner/date columns | yes |

## Compressed output format

**git status**
```
branch:main=origin/main ↑2
staged(3):
  modified: pkg/{foo,bar}.go
  new: pkg/baz.go
unstaged(1):
  modified: main.go
untracked(2): tmp/{debug.log,notes.txt}
```

## Commands

```sh
tko [--sample] -- <command> [args]   # run and compress
tko stats                            # token savings summary
tko misses                           # top unhandled commands by potential savings
tko misses 'git log'                 # zoom into a specific prefix
tko rewrite '<cmd>'                  # test hook rewriting
tko hook install                     # set up Claude Code hook
tko hook uninstall                   # remove hook
tko hook status                      # check hook state
```

`--sample` prints compression stats to stderr without affecting stdout — useful for benchmarking a handler against a real repo.

---

## Discovering what to implement next

```sh
tko misses
```
```
prefix        seen  avg tokens   potential
------        ----  ----------   ---------
git diff         2       29.0k       58.0k
npm test         1        8.1k        8.1k
```

`potential = count × avg_tokens` — the highest rows are the best next handlers to write.

---

## Adding a handler

Handlers must be lossless. If you can't guarantee that, don't add the handler.

**1. Create** `internal/commands/<name>/<subcmd>.go`:
```go
package mycommand

import "tko/internal/commands"

func init() { commands.Register(&myHandler{}) }

type myHandler struct{}

func (h *myHandler) Route() string    { return "mycmd" }

func (h *myHandler) Supports(args []string) bool {
    // Strip global flags, match exact subcommand + arg pattern you own.
    return len(args) > 0 && args[0] == "subcommand"
}

func (h *myHandler) Handle(args []string, rawStdout, rawStderr string) (*commands.Result, error) {
    return &commands.Result{
        Stdout:   compress(rawStdout),
        Lossless: true,
    }, nil
}
```

**2. Import** in `cmd/tko/main.go`:
```go
_ "tko/internal/commands/mycommand"
```

**3. Test** in `<name>/<subcmd>_test.go` — shell out to the real binary, create a temp environment, assert output correctness. See `internal/commands/git/status_test.go` for the pattern.

---

## Design principles

- **Lossless only** — if a handler can't preserve all information, it passes through raw
- **Never fail the agent** — if a handler errors, `tko` falls back to raw passthrough and logs to `~/.local/share/tko/errors.log`
- **No compound commands** — `&&`, `||`, `;`, `|` are never rewritten
- **Transparent** — exit codes, stdin, and stderr are forwarded exactly
